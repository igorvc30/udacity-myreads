   * have its data altered inside of state, and finaly trigger the rendering to update the shelves.
   * Solution found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45878147/how-to-update-an-object-in-an-array-of-objects-using-setstate
   * If the API request is successful the state of the book will be update to the new shelf and a
   * notification will apear, in case o error a notification will apear and once the promise is solve
   * the loading state will be changed to false
