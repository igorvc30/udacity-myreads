# MyReads 

MyReads is the 1st project from Udacity React Developer Course from the 1st part of content (components, props/states, router and api fetch). This is a small project, a book organizer. Users Story requirements:
  - As a user, I want 3 book shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read, so that I can organize all my books
  - As a user, I want to change a book shelf, or even remove the book, so that I can keep my shelves updated.
  - As a user, I want to search for new books, so that I can add new books to my shelves.
  - As a user, I want to navigate to Homepage from anywhere, so that I can always check my shelves.

# New Features!

  - As a user, I want to see more details about a book, so that I can learn more about a book.

### Tech

MyReads uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create ReactApp](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Prop-types] - Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects.
* [React Router] - React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
* [Ant Design] - An enterprise-class UI design language and React-based implementation with a set of high-quality React components.
* [NPM] - A package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
* [ESLint] - A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

### Installation

MyReades requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run.

Install the dependencies and run the app.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/igorvc30/udacity-myreads.git
$ cd udacity-myreads
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
